# www.nuts.nl

The "webpresence" site for Nuts, where we tell the world who we are. Nothing
very complicated or special, it's a regular statically generated
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.

Hosting is done through [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). So be advised
that pushing to master is equal to deploying.

## Podcast

One thing to notice is that it's also where we host our Going Nuts podcast. So
when refactoring this project in the future, please do keep that in mind ;)

The podcast lives at `https://nuts.nl/going-nuts.xml`.
