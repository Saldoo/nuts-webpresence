# www.nuts.nl

The "webpresence" site for Nuts, where we tell the world who we are. Nothing
very complicated or special, it's a regular statically generated
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site.

Hosting is done through [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). So be advised
that pushing to master is equal to deploying.

## Podcast

One thing to notice is that it's also where we host our Going Nuts podcast. So
when refactoring this project in the future, please do keep that in mind ;)

The podcast lives at `https://nuts.nl/going-nuts.xml`.

## Local development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
