# Privacy policy Nuts.nl

Nuts is about privacy. So we treat the data of our visitors with care on this website. For example, we have not used the standard plugins for social media that would allow parties such as Facebook to track you.

## What do we do?

We use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for web hosting. This allows us to maintain and host a website with developers from different parties. Github has a [privacy statement](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/) that states which data it stores about its users.

We use the services of [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for our mailing list. We have chosen to only request an e-mail address for this service. You can choose to save your first and last name to Mailchimp later, which we use to personalize e-mails. For more information, see the [Mailchimp privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/). If you want to unsubscribe from the mailing list, you can do so via the link at the bottom of the e-mails you receive.

We use Google Analytics to gain anonymous insight into the number of visitors to this website. For this purpose cookies are placed in your browser. We cannot trace these visitor statistics back to individual people. In addition, we use Google Calendar for our community calendar. This calendar is loaded from the Google domain when you visit our [community](/community) page. Finally, we use Google Fonts, which we also load from a Google domain. For more information, see the (very extensive) [privacy policy of Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en).

If you have any suggestions as to how we can better guarantee the privacy of our visitors, we would love to hear from you through [info@nuts.nl](mailto:info@nuts.nl).
